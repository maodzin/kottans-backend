# Hi!
## I'm glad to be here!
All stuff is new for me but very **useful**!

## Git Collaboration

- Git Collabaration is very useful and very powerful in team work
- To remember all commands and fluent applying in work require some experience

## Unix Shell

- Useful issue with file manipulation
- Navigation is a little familiar from previous experience
- Certainly, I'll use shell commands in future
- I/O redirection and pipelines issue have to be practice 
- Expensions is mighty thing
