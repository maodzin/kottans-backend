# Hi!
## I'm glad to be here!
All stuff is new for me but very **useful**!

## Unix Shell


- Useful issue with file manipulation
- Navigation is a little familiar from previous experience
- Certainly, I'll use shell commands in future
- I/O redirection and pipelines issue have to be practice 
- Expensions is mighty thing
